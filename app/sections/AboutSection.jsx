          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify">
            Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Oladayo Akinmokun</strong>, a corporate commercial lawyer with a large sprinkle of litigation. 
            As a corporate commercial lawyer, I focus on <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> and <strong>Data Privacy</strong>, helping businesses 
            and professionals navigate the complexities of legal compliance.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify">
            With over three years of experience in the courtroom, I understand what it means to defend and protect the interests of my clients 
            across different cadres of court.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify">
            Let it be known that Iâ€™m big on <strong>Personal Branding</strong>, which is why I help lawyers build a strong online presence. 
            My mission is simple: <strong>Empower and protect</strong>.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify">
            When Iâ€™m not deep in legal frameworks or content strategy, youâ€™ll probably find me watching K-dramas, vibing to BTS 
            (<em>Jungkook, I see you! ðŸ˜†</em>), or brainstorming my next big project.
          </p>
